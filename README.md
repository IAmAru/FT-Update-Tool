# FT-Update-Tool
Wrote this for a Smash Bros. tournament series I host. Works to update several files within a certain folder, which are then updated in OBS.
I hope if this tool is used, it'll help run tournament streams smoother for whoever's using it-- this is meant to mirror the Scoreboard application, with a few more features dedicated to the Smash Bros. community.

Thanks for looking!
